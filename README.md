"Our deep learning model for mouth cancer detection achieved a high Test Accuracy of 93.62%, Precision of 93.94%, and Recall of 92.54%.
This indicates strong ability to detect cancer correctly while minimizing both false positives and false negatives, making the model suitable for assisting early diagnosis."

"After training and testing on the provided dataset, I evaluated the model on completely unseen real-world images downloaded from Google.
The model successfully classified normal and cancerous images with high confidence, showing strong generalization ability beyond the training dataset."
